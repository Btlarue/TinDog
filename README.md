# TinDog
Project utilizing CSS, and Bootstrap.

I am using this project to further develop my knowledge of coding languages. This project is focused heavily on CSS at an intermediate level. 
I intend to practice design theory, color theory, typography, as well as following best practices when it comes to UI/UX.

The Bootstrap library will be implementented to aid in the learning process when working with external libraries.

The inspriation for this project is to create a similar homepage of a well known company. In this example, I will make my own mock of Tindr, but for dogs! Tindogs!
The use of colors, styles, fonts, webframes, libraries, and much more will be used to pull this off.
